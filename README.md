### Project Objectives
<!-- **A website for restaurant management which will have the following features:** -->
* Here, we want to provide a service for medium-to-high end restaurants to avail more reservations.
* Since our service is similar to "Bookmyshow" or "Zomato", restaurants would also get organic marketing in a similar manner.
* Our website would also help users to find good restaurants in their area.


#### FRAMEWORK AND LANGUAGE USED 
1. HTML/CSS
